# Nexter

Project using only HTML and SCSS to learn development with CSS Grid and implementing responsive design, with no Javascript and therefore no functionality.

- HTML follows the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention.
- Using Media Queries at different viewport dimensions for different devices
- CSS Grid positioning (grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows etc..) and using functions such as min-content, max-content, auto-fit, auto-fill and minmax(). 
- Positioning using Explicit and Implicit Grid layouts.
- Practice development with SCSS, Partials, and using NPM packages to install SASS locally.
